/*
A vertex in an undirected connected graph is an articulation point (or cut vertex)
iff removing it (and edges through it) disconnects the graph. Articulation points
represent vulnerabilities in a connected network – single points whose failure
would split the network into 2 or more disconnected components. They are useful
for designing reliable networks.

For a disconnected undirected graph, an articulation point is a vertex removing
which increases number of connected components.

A simple approach is to one by one remove all vertices and see if removal of a
vertex causes disconnected graph.

1) For every vertex v, do following
    a) Remove v from graph
    b) See if the graph remains connected (We can either use BFS or DFS)
    c) Add v back to the graph

Time complexity of above method is O(V*(V+E)) for a graph represented using
adjacency list. Can we do better? 

The idea is to use DFS (Depth First Search). In DFS, we follow vertices in tree
form called DFS tree. In DFS tree, a vertex u is parent of another vertex v,
if v is discovered by u (obviously v is an adjacent of u in graph).

In DFS tree, a vertex u is articulation point if one of the following two
conditions is true.
    1) u is root of DFS tree and it has at least two children.
    2) u is not root of DFS tree and it has a child v such that no vertex
       in subtree rooted with v has a back edge to one of the ancestors of u.

We do DFS traversal of given graph with additional code to find out Articulation
Points (APs). In DFS traversal, we maintain a parent[] array where parent[u]
stores parent of vertex u. Among the above mentioned two cases, the first case
is simple to detect. For every vertex, count children. If currently visited
vertex u is root (parent[u] is NIL) and has more than two children, print it.

How to handle second case?

The second case is trickier. We maintain an array disc[] to store discovery
time of vertices. For every node u, we need to find out the earliest visited
vertex (the vertex with minimum discovery time) that can be reached from
subtree rooted with u. So we maintain an additional array low[] which is
defined as follows.

    low[u] = min(disc[u], disc[w])

where w is an ancestor of u and there is a back edge from some descendant of u to w.
